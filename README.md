Estimate ML model sizes!

Built as a study tool to help people get better at making ballpark model size estimates. This is something I always wish I was better at and wanted to build a tool that makes it at least a little bit fun to practice.

I'm just getting started but I'll leave the repo public from the start. Updates to come.
